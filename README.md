# TO-DO Project | CRUD | MVC
This project is a to-do list that uses CRUD and MVC principals

**Link to project: Coming Soon!


## How It's Made:

Tech used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, EJS, and Mongoose

This to-do app was created to solidify my learning with CRUD and MVC. I use Node for the backend, creating my api to perform CRUD applications. Also, I comply with MVC by creating a separation of concerns allowing for a much more organized file system.

## Optimizations:
	□ Add pomodoro timer
	□ Allow multiple Pomodoro's
	□ Create a settings tab
	□ User decides how long the timer is
	□ Ask user if they are ready for x amount of Pomodoro's
	□ Allow users to create multiple different lists
	□ Allow users to set goals and use the to-dos for micro goals
	□ Users when creating subtasks for their goal can create their own levels where they can unlock achievement badges.



## Lessons Learned:
The power of MVC makes it much easier to find/troubleshoot what you looking for. Also, much added benefits to sharing your code with someone and they can instantly know how the infrastructure should be and contribute much faster.
